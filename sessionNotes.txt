	Three A's of Unit Testing
		A ==> Arrange (usually an initial state) - 
		Arrange all necessary preconditions and inputs

		A ==> Act (usually change the state)
		Act on the object or method under test
	
		A ==> Assert (Check for asserstion)
		Assert that the expected results have occurred


Why to use NO_ERRORS_SCHEMAS : it ignores the html elements, but should be used only when reqd.
fixture.detectChanges() ==>The bindings in the html will be resolved by the detectChanges() method
TestBed.configureTestingModule({}) will create a testing module. And in this module we can add
declarations[], providers[] etc


debugElement - is like a wrapper arround a DOM node like how a 
		fixture is a wrapper arround a component
